Configuration
=============

.. attention::

   This section is only needed for TYPO3 v9 and v10, as since v11 all
   translation configuration is done in the SiteConfiguration instead.

This extension ships a backend module for configuring translations.
Inside the backend module all available local languages are listed and you have
to assign a :ref:`DeepL conform language key <DeepL>`
